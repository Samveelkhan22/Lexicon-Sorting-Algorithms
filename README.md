# Lexicon-Sorting-Algorithms
This repository contains Python code for sorting a lexicon using two different sorting algorithms: Insertion Sort and Quick Sort. The lexicon is represented as a collection of Word objects, each storing the frequency and list of neighbors for a word.

# Introduction
In this project, we implement two sorting algorithms, Insertion Sort and Quick Sort, to manage a lexicon data structure. The lexicon is populated with words from provided text files and sorted alphabetically. Additionally, the lexicon is augmented with a list of neighbors for each word, where a neighbor differs by only one letter and has the same length.

#Files
